## Content

- The notebook is slightly smaller than A7 (due to the cuts): roughly 10cm x 7cm.
- It has 16 numbered pages...
    - ...including a cute front cover.
    - The pages 2 to 16 have a 5mm grid.

## Requirements

- **A4 sheet**
- **Printer** (grayscale is enough)
- **Stapler** (alternatively: book binding tools)
- **Scissors** or **paper cutter**

## Instructions

**_Optional_**: edit the vector graphic template [A7-PandaNotebook.svg](images/A7-PandaNotebook.svg) if needed. It was created with the free and open source software [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), after observing how pages behave when folding an A4 sheet into A7. If needed, export to PDF at the end.

The instructions are summarized here:

![Instructions](images/instructions.png)

### 1. Printing 🖨️ 

Print the template PDF [A7-PandaNotebook.pdf](A7-PandaNotebook.pdf) **double-sided** on an A4 sheet, **no scaling** (the template PDF is already A4).

### 2. Folding 📃
Following the small squares printed with the numbers "1", "2" and "3", create the 1st, 2nd and 3rd folds. For instance, the two "1" have to touch each other.

**Remark**: Make the folds as precise as possible by using the middle line on the other side of the number, which becomes an edge once folded. Preferably don't use the outer edges of the A4 sheet, because most printers don't perfectly center prints.

### 3. Stapling 📌

Using a desk stapler, or even with bookbinding tools (piercing awl, needle and thread), create the binding. If you use a stapler, I recommand two staples (each 2cm from the border).

**Remark**: If you stapler is too small to reach the middle line and you cannot open your stapler wide open, you can gently fold the pages without too much pressure to make it fit in the staple, as shown below:

### 4. Cutting ✂️

Using scissors, or better: a paper cutter, cut few millimeters of the two edges that are closed to open them.

_Tada!_ You are now the happy owner of a tiny cute notebook that fits in your pocket!

## FAQ

- _Why **panda** notebook?_
    - Because it's black and white, I like monochrome, like black ink on white paper.
    - Also because a panda embodies being chill and taking things easy.
    - Be a panda.
- _Why would you even create this? What's the point??_
    - Because I'm trying to be less distracted by my phone but still be able to quickly note down ideas, references (books, movies, podcasts, ...) to process later.
    - I realized that a lot of existing notebooks (either digital templates or physical notebooks) are either paid, or limited. For instance, I like the idea of the [PocketMode](https://pocketmod.com/), but I prefer to have more and nicer pages.
    - I started creating my own tiny notebook by folding, binding and cutting A4 sheets (it reminded me of my childhood in school...), and I found them so cool that I wanted to share them.
