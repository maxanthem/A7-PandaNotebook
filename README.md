# Panda Notebook
A 16 pages A7 pocket notebook to create from an A4 sheet.

## Requirements

- **A4 sheet**
- **Printer** (grayscale is enough)
- **Stapler** (alternatively: book binding equipment)
- **Scissors** or **paper cutter**

## Instructions

**_Optional_**: edit the vector graphic template [A7-PandaNotebook.svg](A7-PandaNotebook.svg) if needed. It was created with the free and open source software [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), after observing how pages behave when folding an A4 sheet into A7. If needed, export to PDF at the end.


The instructions are summarized here:

### 1. Printing 🖨️ 

Print the template PDF [A7-PandaNotebook.pdf](A7-PandaNotebook.pdf) **double-sided** on an A4 sheet, **no scaling** (the template PDF is already A4).


### 2. Folding 📃

Following the small squares with the numbers "1", "2" and "3", create the 1st, 2nd and 3rd folds (e.g. the two "1" have to touch each other).

**Remark**: Make the folds as precise as possible by using the middle line on the other side of the number, which becomes an edge once folded. Preferably don't use the outer edges of the A4 sheet, because most printers don't center perfectly the prints.


### 3. Stapling 📌

Using a desk stapler, or a stapler that can open, or even with bookbinding tools (piercing awl, needle and thread), create the binding. I recommand two staples (each 2cm from the border).
If you stapler is too small to reach the middle line, you can gently fold the pages without too much pressure to make the 

### 4. Cutting ✂️
